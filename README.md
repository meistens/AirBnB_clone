# AirBnB_clone

## Project Description
This project is an AirBnB_clone command interpreter written in Python. The interpreter allows a user to input commands and interact with the program.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a text-based interface that allows users to enter and execute commands. Think of it as a terminal interface to a program.

Here, in the AirBnB clone, the interpreter will be used to manage the objects created, like the following:

 - Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
 - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
 - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
 - Update attributes of an object
 - Destroy an object

### How to Start The Interpreter
