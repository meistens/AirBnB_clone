# AirBnB_clone

## Description
AirBnB shell interpreter written in Python.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a program that allows one enter commands and executes those same commands. Think of it as a terminal interface to a program (but it is not per se). Unlike a GUI, commands run are purely text keyed in.

Here, in the AirBnB clone, the interpreter will be used to manage the objects created, like the following:

 - Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
 - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
 - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
 - Update attributes of an object
 - Destroy an object
